**Club Connect**

The Club Connect website project aims to revolutionize the club experience by addressing
critical challenges faced by student clubs on campus. By leveraging advanced web
development technologies such as PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, the project
seeks to create a centralized platform that enhances communication, coordination, and
information access within clubs. Key features include dynamic committee and club pages,
user authentication systems for Convener and Superadmin roles, and responsive design for
seamless user experience across devices. Additionally, the website includes a notice board
section for displaying real-time event information, further fostering engagement and
collaboration within the campus community. Through comprehensive data collection,
management, and privacy measures, the Club Connect website endeavors to streamline club
operations, empower club leaders, and cultivate a more connected and vibrant campus
environment.

**Club Connect**

The Club Connect website project for all the clubs and committees of the college. It addresses
critical challenges faced by student clubs on campus by using web development technologies 
such as PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. The website seeks to create a centralized 
platform that enhances communication, coordination, and information access within clubs. 
Key features include:
1. Dynamic committee and club pages.
2. Seperate Convener Login for updating and managing committee/club pages.
3. Superadmin Login which will have the access to register new committees/clubs.

Additionally, the website includes a notice board section for displaying real-time event information,
further fostering engagement andcollaboration within the campus community. 

Through comprehensive data collection, management, and privacy measures, 
the Club Connect website endeavors to streamline club operations, and cultivate a more connected and vibrant campusenvironment.
